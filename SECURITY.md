## What We Care About

- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- SQL injection or other database access issues
- Exposure of sensitive data (e.g. `.env`, passwords, API keys)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) or request forgery (CSRF)
- Privilege escalation (e.g. admin access without authorization)
- Issues in dependencies that affect this project

## Out of Scope

- Issues in Ollama or other external services we integrate with (report to those projects)
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a practical exploit path
- Social engineering or physical access attacks

## Acknowledgments

We thank security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly. Contributors who help improve security will be acknowledged (with their permission) in release notes or a dedicated acknowledgments section.
