## System Overview

A Flask web application that fetches news from RSS feeds and open publisher APIs on a schedule, rewrites each article via Ollama (local LLM) to match a reader's accessibility profile, and presents the result in a clean, accessible reader interface.

The system has no client-side rendering. Flask renders all HTML server-side via Jinja2. HTMX makes targeted requests to Flask routes and swaps HTML fragments into the page. PostgreSQL stores user accounts, fetched articles, clusters, rewritten content, and all configuration.

A five-stage pipeline runs on a background schedule (APScheduler): fetch feeds → enrich (extract full text) → embed → cluster → rewrite. When a user opens the app, content is already ready.

### Pipeline Flow Diagram

![Pipeline flow: News Sources → Fetch → Enrich → Embed → Cluster → Rewrite → PostgreSQL](pipeline-flow-diagram.png)

| Stage | Component | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1. Fetch | `app/feed/` | Fetch RSS feeds, parse XML, deduplicate, insert raw articles |
| 2. Enrich | `app/extraction/` | Trafilatura extracts full text from article URLs; updates `articles` |
| 3. Embed | `app/llm/embeddings.py` | Ollama (nomic-embed-text) embeds each article; stores vectors |
| 4. Cluster | `app/clustering/` | Cosine similarity + Union-Find groups related articles into clusters |
| 5. Rewrite | `app/services/rewrite_service.py` | LLM merges cluster articles into one accessible article per profile |

The worker runs on a schedule (fetch every 60 min; enrich at :05; cluster at :15; rewrite daily at 06:00). When content is ready, any user whose preferred (style, language) matches an existing cluster rewrite sees it immediately.

## Request Lifecycle

### First-time setup

```
User opens app
    → GET /
    → Flask checks: is user logged in?
    → No: redirect to GET /login (or /register for new users)
    → After login, Flask checks: does this user have a profile?
    → No: redirect to GET /setup
    → User fills in: location, language, topics, preferred style (neutral/simple), negative news filter
    → POST /setup → validate, store in PostgreSQL → redirect to /
```

### Normal open (content already scheduled)

```
User opens app
    → GET /
    → Flask queries PostgreSQL: get clusters + cached rewrites for user's (style, language) variant
    → Returns full article list immediately — no LLM calls made
    → User sees today's digest with 3-line summaries
```

### Feed sections (topic filtering)

The main feed shows a section navigation bar built from the user's selected topics (from setup/settings). Each section has a label and icon (configured in `config/app.yaml` under `topics`).

```
User opens app
    → GET /
    → Section nav: "All" | Politics | Society | Culture | … (one per user topic)
    → Clicking a section: GET /?topic=politics
    → Feed filtered to clusters matching that topic (article categories or source topics)
    → Category chips on article cards are hidden when viewing a section (redundant)
```

- **All** — shows every cluster matching the user's sources and topics.
- **Section (e.g. Politics)** — shows only clusters where at least one article matches the topic (via RSS categories or the article's source topic list).
- Topic labels and icons are defined in `config/app.yaml` → `topics`. Keys must match topic IDs in `config/sources.yaml`.

### New user before first scheduled rewrite

```
User opens app for the first time after completing setup
    → GET /
    → Flask checks: any cached rewrites for this user's profile?
    → No: return page with message "Your articles are being prepared"
    → APScheduler picks up the new user's profile in the next rewrite cycle
    → On next visit (or via HTMX polling), content is ready
```

### Article expansion

```
User taps "Read more"
    → hx-get="/clusters/<cluster_id>/expand"
    → Flask queries PostgreSQL: get cached cluster rewrite for this cluster + (style, language) variant
    → Returns partials/article_expanded.html with cached content
    → HTMX swaps the partial into #article-{id}
```

## Component Map

### `app/feed/`

Responsible for fetching and normalising content from RSS feeds.

For automated source discovery (location-based discovery, feed detection, quality scoring), see `docs/news_source_discovery_agent.md`. The Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/news-source-discovery.mdc` applies when working in this area.

- `fetcher.py` — fetches RSS feeds via HTTP, returns `FetchResult` with content and conditional headers
- `parser.py` — parses feed XML via `feedparser`, returns `RawArticle` objects
- `orchestrator.py` — fetches all due feeds, parses, deduplicates, inserts articles; circuit breaker for failing feeds

A `RawArticle` has: `id`, `title`, `url`, `source`, `published_at`, `raw_text` (RSS description/lede), `full_text` (populated when the source provides full article content).

### `app/llm/`

The LLM abstraction layer. Nothing outside this directory calls Ollama directly.

- `provider.py` — `LLMProvider` abstract base class and `OllamaProvider` implementation
- `embeddings.py` — `EmbeddingProvider` for article clustering; Ollama (nomic-embed-text)
- `prompts/` — prompt template files (`.txt`); `rewrite_cluster_neutral.txt` and `rewrite_cluster_simple.txt` merge multiple articles into one accessible article per reading style

### `app/clustering/`

Article clustering by embedding similarity. Groups articles about the same event into clusters.

- `service.py` — embeds articles, clusters by cosine similarity (Union-Find), creates cluster records

### `app/extraction/`

Full-text extraction from article URLs.

- `extractor.py` — batch enrichment for articles with `extraction_status = 'pending'`
- `trafilatura.py` — fetches URL and extracts main body via Trafilatura

### `app/discovery/`

News source discovery: feed detection, validation, quality scoring.

- `feed_detection.py` — validates feed URLs, returns completeness and item count
- `validation.py` — DNS checks, HTTPS validation
- `scoring.py` — quality score from feed completeness, type, frequency, HTTPS

### `app/services/`

Business logic. Routes call services; services do the work.

- `article_service.py` — get today's clusters for a user, score and filter by topic, select best image; optional `topic_filter` restricts feed to a single section
- `profile_service.py` — create/update user profile, resolve (style, language) reading variant
- `rewrite_service.py` — rewrite clusters for all configured (style, language) variants, manage cache
- `auth_service.py` — user registration, login, session management

### `app/db/`

All PostgreSQL access. No other module writes to the database directly.

- `articles.py` — read/write for articles (including embeddings, extraction status)
- `clusters.py` — clusters, cluster_articles, cluster_rewrites
- `sources.py` — news_sources, source_feeds, source_discovery_log
- `rewrite_requests.py` — on-demand rewrite queue infrastructure (table + DB layer exist; not yet wired to routes or scheduler)
- `users.py` — read/write for users and profiles
- `admin.py` — admin dashboard queries (job runs, overview stats, feed health, incidents)
- `connection.py` — connection pool management

### `app/routes/`

Flask blueprints. Routes are thin wrappers: parse request, call service, return template.

- `reader.py` — main reader interface (`/`, `/?topic=<id>`, `/feed`, `/clusters/<id>/expand`, `/article/<cluster_id>`)
- `auth.py` — login, register, logout
- `setup.py` — initial configuration wizard (`GET /setup`, `POST /setup`)
- `settings.py` — configuration interface; allows editing profile fields after initial setup
- `admin.py` — admin dashboard (`GET /admin`, `GET /admin/partials/jobs`); requires `is_admin`

### `app/templates/`

Jinja2 templates. Pages extend `base.html`. HTMX responses use partials. Templates live at project root `templates/`, not under `app/`.

```
templates/
├── base.html               # Shell: nav, font settings; contains inline <script> for Web Speech API TTS only

## Configuration

All config lives in `config/`. The app reads it at startup. No config is hardcoded.

### `config/app.yaml`

# Topic labels, icons and emojis. Keys must match topic ids in sources.
topics:

  society: { label: Society, icon: users, emoji: "👥" }
  culture: { label: Culture, icon: palette, emoji: "🎭" }

  economy: { label: Economy, icon: trending-up, emoji: "📈" }
  science: { label: Science, icon: flask, emoji: "🔬" }
  sports: { label: Sports, icon: trophy, emoji: "⚽" }
```

> **Note:** `SECRET_KEY` is loaded directly from the environment (`.env`) by the Flask app factory — not via `app.yaml`. YAML is for non-secret config only.

**Topics config:** The `topics` block maps topic IDs (from `sources.yaml`) to display labels and icons used in the feed section navigation. Add entries for any topic ID used by sources; `app.config.get_topic_info()` falls back to a generic label/icon for unknown IDs.

### `config/sources.yaml`

Defines the catalog of available sources and their metadata. Each source should include a `topics` list. User selections are stored in PostgreSQL via the setup wizard and settings page.

```yaml
sources:
  - id: "3cat"
    name: "3Cat Notícies"
    domain: "www.3cat.cat"
    homepage_url: "https://www.3cat.cat/"
    country_code: "ES"
    region: "Catalonia"
    languages: ["ca"]
    topics: ["general"]
    full_text: true
    feeds:
      - url: "https://www.3cat.cat/rss/noticia/catala/rss.xml"
        type: rss
        label: main

  - id: "elcritic"
    name: "El Crític"
    domain: "www.elcritic.cat"
    homepage_url: "https://www.elcritic.cat/"
    country_code: "ES"
    region: "Catalonia"
    languages: ["ca"]
    topics: ["politics", "society"]
    full_text: true
    feeds:
      - url: "https://www.elcritic.cat/feed"
        type: rss
        label: main
```

## LLM Processing Detail

### Cluster rewrite prompts

The system ships two prompt templates in `app/llm/prompts/`:

- `rewrite_cluster_neutral.txt` — journalistic tone: formal, well-written, preserves complexity.
- `rewrite_cluster_simple.txt` — simplified tone: short sentences, plain vocabulary, no jargon.

Both prompts merge multiple articles about the same event into one unified article. Template variables: `{language}`, `{summary_sentences}`, `{articles_text}`.

Output format (exact headers required by the parser):

```
TITLE:
One headline.

SUMMARY:
{summary_sentences} plain sentences.

FULL:
Full article.
```

### (style, language) variant system

Rewrites are **cluster-level, not per-user**. The system generates one cached rewrite per `(cluster_id, style, language)` combination. All users who share the same preferred style and language share the same cached rewrite — the LLM is never called twice for the same combination.

Styles and languages are defined in `config/app.yaml` under `rewriting.styles` and `rewriting.languages`. The two active styles map to prompt files:

| Style ID | Prompt file | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | `rewrite_cluster_neutral.txt` | Neutral |
| `simple` | `rewrite_cluster_simple.txt` | Simple |

The user's `preferred_style` (set in setup/settings) and `language` together select the correct cached rewrite when they open the feed.

### Rewrite scheduling

The daily rewrite job (APScheduler, default 06:00):

1. Reads all configured `(style, language)` variants from config
2. For each variant, finds clusters without a cached rewrite (within the cluster window)
3. For each cluster, merges articles via LLM and stores in `cluster_rewrites`

The `rewrite_requests` table and `app/db/rewrite_requests.py` exist as infrastructure for future on-demand rewrites (triggered when a user saves setup/settings). This is not yet wired to routes or the scheduler; all rewrites are currently driven by the daily batch job.

**`filter_negative` note:** The `filter_negative` preference is stored per user in `user_profiles` and displayed in the setup/settings UI. It is not currently passed to the LLM prompt — the cluster-level rewrite prompts do not include a filter-negative instruction. This is a planned feature; the stored preference will be available when it is implemented.

### Daily digest delivery

The daily digest is an **in-app experience only**. There is no email or push notification. When a user opens the app after the rewrite job has run, their feed shows all clusters that have a cached rewrite matching their `(style, language)` variant — no waiting, no loading spinner.

The `user_read_clusters` table exists as infrastructure for future per-user read-state tracking (e.g. "N new articles since your last visit"). The DB table is defined in migration 010 but has no application code layer yet; read state is not currently tracked.

### Language and source mismatch

If a user sets `language = "en"` but selects Catalan-language sources, the LLM rewrites the article **in the user's configured language** (English), effectively translating it. The rewrite prompt always specifies the target language. There is no pre-filtering by source language.

Caregivers should be aware of this during setup: the setup wizard should display each source's language so they can make an informed selection. Cross-language selections are allowed; translation is automatic.

---

## Operational Rules

### Admin dashboard

Operators can monitor the system at `/admin`. Access requires `is_admin = true` on the user account. Grant via `flask make-admin <email>`. The dashboard shows job run history, feed health, article pipeline stats, clustering coverage, user activity, and auto-detected incidents. See [docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md](ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md).

### APScheduler and Gunicorn workers

**Hard rule:** APScheduler must only run in the `scheduler` container (entrypoint: `python -m app.scheduler`). It must never be imported or started inside the `web` container.

If APScheduler is started inside a Gunicorn process, every worker spawns its own scheduler, causing every scheduled job to run N times (where N = number of workers). This causes duplicate fetches, duplicate rewrites, and duplicate LLM charges.

- The `web` container runs `gunicorn` only — no scheduler import, no `scheduler.start()` call anywhere in the Flask app factory or any module it imports at startup.
- The `scheduler` container imports and starts APScheduler in `app/scheduler.py` (the `__main__` module), which is a separate process that never handles HTTP requests.
- Do not add `scheduler.start()` to `create_app()` or any Flask init code, even for convenience during development.

## What This System Is Not

- Not a scraper. It uses RSS and official APIs.
- Not a republisher. Every article links to and credits the original source.
- Not a single-page application. There is no client-side routing.
- Not cloud-dependent for LLM. It uses Ollama (local) — no API key required; runs fully offline after models are pulled.
